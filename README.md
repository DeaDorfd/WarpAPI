# WarpAPI
WarpAPI for the game Minecraft

## How to use?

It's very simple import this into your plugin and then load the WarpAPI on the server and now you can use the API properly.

This is how the API works:
WarpAPI.setWarp(player, warpname);
WarpAPI.warp(player, warpname);
WarpAPI.delwarp(warpname);

You can download the plugin from SpigotMC (link: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/warpapi.70278/).

## For which Minecraft versions does this API work?

The API works in any Minecraft version.
